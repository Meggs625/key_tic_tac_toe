A Quick Tic Tac Toe

Basic functionality is there for the game, however, I did not make it to the steps to store the information. I have the function set aside, but had not yet captured the information. Give more time, I would have been able to add functionality to store the game round information, the game winner, and the array of values to show a snapshop of the gameboard. 

There are a lot of stylistic changes I would like to make as well. With more time, I would love to add a more modern look to the board, some animation and hover effects. Possibly some confetti upon a win!
